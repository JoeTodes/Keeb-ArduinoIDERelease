* Download and unzip the ZIP
* Copy the entire Keeb folder into the "Arduino" folder on your computer (usually this is Documents/Arduino)
* Open the Keeb.ino file, this will launch the Arduino IDE
* You'll need to install a few Arduino libraries. Go to Tools->Manage Libraries and search for:
  - HID-Project
  - ArduinoSTL
  - Encoder
* Edit Keeb.ino based on your wiring

* To upload the code to your Arduino, first go to Tools->Board and choose "Arduino Micro"
 * If "Arduino Micro" isn't on the list, you might need to click "Boards Manager" to update
* Then you can plug in your Arduino, hit "Upload", and cross your fingers!
